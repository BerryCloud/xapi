/**
 * This sample demonstrates how the xAPI model can be used in applications that receive statements.
 * <p>
 * The xapi-model package can be used on server side too. Most commercial xAPI LRS implementations
 * provide some kind of statement-forwarding feature. Using this feature you can easily implement
 * custom functionalities which can be triggered when an xAPI statement is sent to the LRS. Eg.
 * creating unique reports, storing the statement or some of its properties in our own database,
 * sending email or text notifications, etc. In certain cases you don't even need an LRS, you can
 * redirect the statements directly to your custom xAPI server. Eventually you can even build a
 * fully functional LRS too.
